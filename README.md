# JavaScript Challenges – Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to the “JavaScript Challenges: Data Structures &amp; Algorithms”.

The goal is to:

- Practice problem solving with JavaScript
- Learn and implement core data structures (stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, hash tables, etc.)
- Understand and apply common algorithms (sorting, recursion, sliding window, etc.)
- Get more comfortable with time and space complexity

---

## 🧱 Structure

- Each **challenge** is implemented as a single `.js` file.
- All solutions are written in **vanilla JavaScript**, runnable with Node.js.

---

# Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/ali-khezri/JavaScript-DSA-Challenges.git

cd JavaScript-DSA-Challenges

---

Notes

These solutions are for learning and practice, not for “perfect” production code.

I may revisit older challenges to refactor and improve performance/readability.

Feedback and alternative solutions are always welcome.
